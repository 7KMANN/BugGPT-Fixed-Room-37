# Vulnerable Web App Analysis and Mitigation

## Exploitation of the SQL Injection Vulnerability

The given Python web application using Flask has a critical vulnerability known as **SQL Injection**. This occurs in the `query_secret()` function where user input is directly included in a SQL query string.

### How the Attack Works

1. **Input Injection**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the `magic_word` parameter. Since this input is directly inserted into the SQL query, an attacker can craft a special input to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

2. **Example Exploit**:
   Suppose an attacker submits `magic_word=1; DROP TABLE secrets; --`
   - The resulting SQL query would be: 
     ```sql
     SELECT secret FROM secrets WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE secrets; -- 
     ```
   - Execution of this would cause the server to first select the secret and subsequently drop the `secrets` table, leading to data loss.

3. **Impact**: This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data leakage, modification, or deletion of entire tables.

## Mitigation Strategies

Developers can adopt several practices to prevent SQL Injection vulnerabilities:

1. **Parameterized Queries**:
   Use parameterized or prepared statements that separate SQL logic from the input values, which greatly reduces the risk of injection.

   **Revised `query_secret()` Function**:
   ```python
   def query_secret(magic_word):
       conn = sqlite3.connect('puzzles.db')
       c = conn.cursor()
       # Use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
       c.execute("SELECT secret FROM secrets WHERE id = ?", (magic_word,))
       result = c.fetchone()
       conn.close()
       return result[0] if result else 'Nothingness engulfs you...'
   ```

2. **Input Validation**:
   - **Type Checking**: Ensure that the `magic_word` is numeric before using it, as the `id` column represents integers:
     ```python
     if not magic_word.isdigit():
         return 'Nothingness engulfs you...'
     ```
   - **Value Range**: Ensure that the value falls within an expected range of `id` numbers.

3. **Use of ORM**:
   - By using Object Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries like SQLAlchemy, developers can further abstract the database interactions, providing an additional layer of protection against SQL Injection.

4. **Database Configurations**:
   - Enable logging and monitor the application for unusual activities to identify potential exploitation attempts early.
   - Use the principle of least privilege for the database user the application connects with, constraining permissions to only what's necessary.

5. **Security Tests**:
   - Conduct regular security testing, including code reviews and penetration testing, to proactively find and resolve vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Conclusion

By implementing these strategies, developers can effectively fortify the application against SQL Injection and protect the sensitive data within the application from unauthorized access and modification.
