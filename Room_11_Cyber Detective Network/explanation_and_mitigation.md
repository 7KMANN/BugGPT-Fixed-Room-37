# Vulnerable Web Application: Cyber Detective Network

## Exploitation of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability

### Description of the Vulnerability

The provided application is susceptible to a **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs because the application accepts a URL from the user and uses it to perform a server-side HTTP request without sufficient validation or filtering. As a result, an attacker can exploit this to make requests from the server to internal services or restricted network resources that are not meant to be exposed externally.

### Exploitation Steps

1. **Locate the Vulnerable Functionality**: The vulnerability is located in the `POST` request handling part of the `/` endpoint, where user input (the `url` field) is directly used in an HTTP request.

2. **Craft Malicious Input**: An attacker can input a URL pointing to internal or sensitive resources. For instance, they could attempt to access an internal cloud metadata service (`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) or databases using a local IP.

3. **Execute the Attack**: By submitting this crafted input, the server executes the request on behalf of the attacker, potentially exposing sensitive information about the internal network.

### Mitigation Strategies

To safeguard against SSRF attacks, developers should adopt the following best practices:

#### 1. Input Validation and Filtering

- **Strict Whitelisting**: Implement strict whitelist-based input validation to allow only URLs from trusted domains. This effectively limits requests to safe and known external domains.

- **Regular Expression Validation**: Enhance validation beyond basic HTTP/HTTPS checks to ensure URLs conform to expected patterns and are not accessing internal or sensitive IP addresses.

#### 2. Use of External Request Libraries

- **Library Features**: Utilize features offered by request libraries to disable redirects and enforce timeouts. Also, consider using libraries designed with security features such as timeout settings and response validation.

#### 3. Network Segmentation and Controls

- **Network Firewalls**: Restrict outbound connections from server applications to only necessary endpoints using firewalls or network security groups.

- **Internal Resource Access Restrictions**: Ensure internal resources or services are not inadvertently exposed to external requests by implementing strict network policies.

#### 4. Request Proxying

- **Outsource Requests to External Services**: Consider using a separate service or proxy for making external requests. This proxy can handle the checking and validation of external requests while limiting the attack surface on the application server.

### Updated Code Implementation Example

Below is a snippet illustrating improved input validation by whitelisting.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
import requests
import re

app = Flask(__name__)

# Whitelisted domains
SAFE_DOMAINS = {'example.com'}

def is_url_safe(url):
    # Only process URLs that belong to the SAFE_DOMAINS
    return any(url.startswith(f"http://{domain}") or url.startswith(f"https://{domain}") for domain in SAFE_DOMAINS)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    error = None
    content = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        url = request.form.get('url')
        if url:
            if is_url_safe(url):
                try:
                    response = requests.get(url)
                    content = response.text[:200]  # Restrict output size
                except Exception as e:
                    error = "An error occurred while scanning the URL. Please try again."
            else:
                error = "Invalid URL domain. Access to this URL is not allowed."
        else:
            error = "No URL provided. Please enter a URL to scan."
    return render_template_string(narrative_page, error=error, content=content)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

By implementing these strategies, developers can effectively mitigate the risk of SSRF vulnerabilities in their applications.

## Conclusion

SSRF vulnerabilities pose significant risks by potentially exposing internal services and sensitive data. Implementing robust input validations, network controls, and leveraging security-oriented library features is essential for developers to prevent exploitation and ensure application security.
