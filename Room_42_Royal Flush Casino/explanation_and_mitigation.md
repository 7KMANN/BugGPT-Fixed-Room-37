The provided Flask web application for "Royal Flush Casino" contains a significant security vulnerability: **SQL Injection (SQLi)**. This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or even complete system compromise. Below is a detailed explanation of how this exploitation can occur in the application and best practices developers should follow to prevent such issues.

---

## **Exploitation: SQL Injection in the Login Route**

### **1. Vulnerable Code Segment**

The vulnerability resides in the `/login` route, specifically in how the SQL query is constructed:

```python
query = """
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}' AND password = '{}'
""".format(username_input, password_input)
```

Here, user-supplied inputs (`username_input` and `password_input`) are directly interpolated into the SQL query string without any sanitization or parameterization. This practice makes the application susceptible to SQL Injection attacks.

### **2. Potential Attack Vectors**

#### **a. Bypassing Authentication**

An attacker can manipulate the input fields to alter the SQL query's logic. For example:

- **Username Input:** `john_doe' --`
- **Password Input:** `anything`

The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe' --' AND password = 'anything'
```

The `--` sequence comments out the rest of the SQL statement, effectively transforming the query to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe'
```

If a user with the username `john_doe` exists, the authentication bypasses the password check, allowing the attacker to log in as that user without knowing the actual password.

#### **b. Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**

The application registers a custom SQLite function `sleep`:

```python
def sqlite_sleep(seconds):
    time.sleep(seconds)

conn.create_function('sleep', 1, sqlite_sleep)
```

This function allows the execution of `sleep(seconds)` within SQL queries. An attacker can exploit this to perform **time-based blind SQL injection** by inferring information based on the response time.

**Example Attack:**

- **Username Input:** `' OR (SELECT CASE WHEN (username LIKE 'admin') THEN sleep(5) ELSE 0 END) --`
- **Password Input:** `anything`

The SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR (SELECT CASE WHEN (username LIKE 'admin') THEN sleep(5) ELSE 0 END) --' AND password = 'anything'
```

If a user with the username `admin` exists, the `sleep(5)` function delays the response by 5 seconds. By measuring the response time, the attacker can infer whether certain conditions in the SQL query are true, effectively allowing them to extract sensitive information without direct feedback.

### **3. Impact of the Exploit**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to user accounts without valid credentials.
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and user balances can be extracted.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might escalate privileges, modify data, or disrupt services.

## **Preventive Measures: Best Practices to Avoid SQL Injection**

### **1. Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**

Instead of embedding user inputs directly into SQL queries, use parameterized queries which treat inputs as data rather than executable code.

**Secure Implementation:**

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
c.execute(query, (username_input, password_input))
```

**Benefits:**

- **Prevents SQL Injection:** Inputs are automatically escaped, neutralizing malicious payloads.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Separates SQL logic from data.

### **2. Utilize Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Frameworks**

ORMs like SQLAlchemy provide high-level abstractions for database interactions, inherently protecting against SQL injection by managing query construction safely.

**Example with SQLAlchemy:**

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    balance = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)

# Secure login query
user = User.query.filter_by(username=username_input, password=password_input).first()
```

### **3. Input Validation and Sanitization**

- **Validate Inputs:** Ensure that inputs conform to expected formats (e.g., usernames contain only alphanumeric characters).
- **Sanitize Inputs:** Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from user inputs.

**Example:**

```python
import re

def is_valid_username(username):
    return re.match("^[A-Za-z0-9_]{3,20}$", username) is not None

if not is_valid_username(username_input):
    # Handle invalid input
```

### **4. Least Privilege Principle**

- **Database User Permissions:** Configure the database to use a user account with the minimal necessary permissions. For instance, the application user should not have administrative privileges.
- **Restrict Database Functions:** Avoid exposing or registering dangerous functions (like `sleep`) unless absolutely necessary.

### **5. Avoid Detailed Error Messages in Production**

Detailed error messages can aid attackers in crafting exploits. Ensure that production environments do not expose stack traces or internal error details to users.

**Secure Error Handling:**

```python
@app.errorhandler(Exception)
def handle_exception(e):
    # Log the error internally
    app.logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    # Show a generic error message to the user
    return render_template('error.html', message="An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."), 500
```

### **6. Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews**

- **Automated Tools:** Use static code analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on security aspects.

### **7. Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**

Deploy a WAF to filter out malicious traffic and provide an additional layer of defense against common web attacks, including SQL injection.

### **8. Educate and Train Development Teams**

Ensure that all developers are aware of common security vulnerabilities and best practices to prevent them. Regular training sessions and security awareness programs can significantly reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

## **Revised Secure Code Example**

Below is a secure version of the `/login` route implementing parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection:

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username_input = request.form.get('username', '')
    password_input = request.form.get('password', '')
    
    # Secure parameterized query
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect('casino.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    try:
        c.execute(query, (username_input, password_input))
        user = c.fetchone()
        conn.close()
        if user:
            session['username'] = user[1]
            return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))
        else:
            return render_template_string('''
            {% extends "index" %}
            {% block message %}
            Invalid username or password.
            {% endblock %}
            ''')
    except Exception as e:
        conn.close()
        # Log the exception internally
        app.logger.error(f"Login error: {e}")
        return render_template_string('''
        {% extends "index" %}
        {% block message %}
        An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.
        {% endblock %}
        ''')
```

**Key Changes:**

- **Parameterized Query:** Replaced string formatting with `?` placeholders and a tuple of parameters to prevent SQL injection.
- **Removed Custom `sleep` Function:** Eliminated the registration of the `sleep` function to remove the attack vector for time-based SQLi.
- **Enhanced Error Logging:** Added server-side logging for exceptions without exposing details to the user.

## **Conclusion**

SQL Injection remains one of the most prevalent and dangerous web application vulnerabilities. By following best practices such as using parameterized queries, leveraging ORM frameworks, validating inputs, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and maintaining secure coding standards, developers can robustly protect applications against such threats. Regular security assessments and fostering a security-first mindset within development teams are essential steps in safeguarding web applications from evolving attack vectors.
