It appears that the specific code for the vulnerable Python web application wasn't included in your message. However, I can provide a general overview of common vulnerabilities in Python web applications, how they can be exploited, and best practices to prevent such security issues. If you have specific code or a particular vulnerability in mind, please share it for a more tailored response.

### Common Vulnerabilities in Python Web Applications

1. **SQL Injection**
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
4. **Insecure Deserialization**
5. **Improper Authentication and Authorization**
6. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
7. **Insecure Configuration**
8. **Sensitive Data Exposure**

Let's delve into a couple of these vulnerabilities, how they can be exploited, and best practices to mitigate them.

#### 1. SQL Injection

**_Exploitation:_**
SQL Injection occurs when an application includes untrusted input in SQL queries without proper validation or escaping. An attacker can manipulate the input to alter the intended SQL command, potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting data.

**_Example Vulnerable Code:_**
```python
from flask import Flask, request
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/user')
def get_user():
    user_id = request.args.get('id')
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    cursor.execute(query)
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()
    return str(user)
```

**_How It Can Be Exploited:_**
If an attacker sends a request like `/user?id=1; DROP TABLE users;`, the query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users;
```
This can lead to deletion of the `users` table.

**_Best Practices to Prevent SQL Injection:_**
- **Use Parameterized Queries:** Instead of string formatting, use parameter binding provided by database libraries.
  
  ```python
  query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
  cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
  ```
  
- **Use ORM Libraries:** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like SQLAlchemy handle query parameterization automatically.
  
- **Input Validation:** Ensure that inputs conform to expected formats (e.g., integers for IDs).

#### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**_Exploitation:_**
XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**_Example Vulnerable Code:_**
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/greet')
def greet():
    name = request.args.get('name')
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

**_How It Can Be Exploited:_**
If an attacker accesses `/greet?name=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the response will execute the JavaScript code, showing an alert box.

**_Best Practices to Prevent XSS:_**
- **Output Encoding:** Encode or escape user inputs before rendering them in the browser. Libraries like Jinja2 (used in Flask) auto-escape by default, but ensure this feature is not disabled.
  
  ```python
  # Ensure Jinja2 autoescape is enabled
  return render_template('greet.html', name=name)
  ```
  
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict sources of executable scripts.
  
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate inputs to allow only expected content.

### General Best Practices for Secure Python Web Development

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated:**
   - Regularly update libraries and frameworks to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` to scan for insecure dependencies.

2. **Proper Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
   - Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate.
   - Ensure users have access only to resources they're authorized to access.

3. **Secure Configuration:**
   - Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.
   - Use environment variables for configuration secrets (e.g., API keys, database passwords).
   - Disable debug mode in production environments.

4. **Use HTTPS:**
   - Encrypt data in transit using TLS.
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

5. **Implement CSRF Protection:**
   - Use CSRF tokens to protect against unauthorized actions.
   - Frameworks like Django and Flask offer extensions (e.g., Flask-WTF) to handle CSRF.

6. **Handle File Uploads Securely:**
   - Validate file types and sizes.
   - Store uploads in non-executable directories.
   - Rename files to avoid path traversal attacks.

7. **Limit Rate and Implement Throttling:**
   - Protect against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single IP.

8. **Use Security Headers:**
   - Implement headers like `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` to enhance security.

9. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
   - Periodically review code for vulnerabilities.
   - Use automated tools and manual testing to identify security flaws.

10. **Educate and Train Development Teams:**
    - Ensure developers are aware of common security vulnerabilities and best practices.
    - Encourage a security-first mindset throughout the development lifecycle.
