It appears that the code or specific details of the vulnerable web application were not included in your message. To provide a comprehensive explanation of the exploitation and suggest best practices to avoid such vulnerabilities, I would need to review the actual code or at least have a detailed description of the vulnerability in question.

**Please provide the following:**
1. **Code Snippets:** Share the relevant portions of the Python web application code that you believe are vulnerable.
2. **Vulnerability Description:** Explain the suspected vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Insecure Direct Object References, etc.).
3. **Contextual Information:** Any additional context that might help in understanding how the application functions and where the potential security flaws lie.

**Once you provide more details, I can assist you by:**
- Explaining how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- Demonstrating the potential impact of such an exploitation.
- Offering best practices and recommendations to mitigate the identified security risks in future development.

Feel free to share the necessary information, and I'll be glad to help you further!
