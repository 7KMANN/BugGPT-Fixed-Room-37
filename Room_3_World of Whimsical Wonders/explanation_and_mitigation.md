# Web App Vulnerability Report: IDOR in Flask Application

The provided web application written in Python with Flask has a notable security vulnerability: **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**. Let's break down the exploitation process, identify the root cause, and suggest best coding practices to mitigate this issue.

## Exploitation Process

### Vulnerability: IDOR
The application's `/character/<username>` endpoint allows users to access personalized character profiles by altering the `username` in the URL. This is an IDOR vulnerability as it provides an attacker with the ability to view characters' private information without proper authorization checks. 

#### Steps to Exploit:
1. **Login to the Application**: As a valid user (e.g., Alice, Bob, or Carol).
2. **Navigate to Profile**: The URL for the user profile might appear as `/character/alice`.
3. **Manipulate the URL**: Change `alice` to `bob` or any other username to access unauthorized profiles, e.g., `/character/bob`.
4. **Gain Unauthorized Access**: The attacker can read sensitive user-specific messages intended for other users.

## Mitigating the Vulnerability

### Best Practices for Developers

1. **Enforce Authorization Checks**: 
   - Ensure that users can only access their own data by checking if the `session['user']` corresponds to the `username` in the URL.
   - Utilize decorators or middleware to enforce access control consistently.

2. **Change Application Logic**: 
   - When redirecting to the profile, use session variables only, avoiding user-controlled input in the URL structure.
   - Example modification for `/profile` view:
     ```python
     @app.route('/profile')
     def profile():
         if 'user' not in session:
             return 'You must log in to continue your adventure!'
         
         username = session['user']
         user = users.get(username)
         if user:
             # respond with the user's profile page
         return 'The mists have obscured this path. Character not found.'
     ```
     By serving profile data based on the authenticated session, we remove the user-controlled parameter from the URL.

3. **Use More Granular Access Tokens**: 
   - Consider implementing more detailed session or token controls that more precisely define what actions a user can perform or what data they can view.

4. **Regular Penetration Testing**: 
   - Regular code audits and penetration testing to uncover and remediate vulnerabilities such as IDOR.

5. **Security Awareness and Training**:
   - Provide security training to developers focused on secure coding practices and awareness of common vulnerabilities like IDOR.

Implementing these changes will greatly enhance the security posture of the application by ensuring sensitive data remains protected from unauthorized access.
