It looks like the code for the vulnerable web application wasn't included in your message. To provide a thorough explanation of the exploitation method and suggest best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities, I would need to review the specific code in question.

Could you please provide the Python code for the web application? Once I have that, I can help you identify potential vulnerabilities, explain how they might be exploited, and offer recommendations to enhance the security of your application.
