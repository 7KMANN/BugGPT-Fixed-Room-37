It looks like the code for the vulnerable Python web application wasn't included in your message. To provide a thorough explanation of the exploitation method and suggest best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities, I need to review the specific code in question.

**Please provide the Python code for the web application**, and I'll be happy to help you analyze its vulnerabilities and offer recommendations to enhance its security.

---

In the meantime, here are some general best practices for developing secure Python web applications:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
   - Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Use libraries like [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.x/) for form validation.

2. **Use Parameterized Queries:**
   - When interacting with databases, use parameterized queries or ORM methods to avoid SQL injection.
   - Example using `sqlite3`:
     ```python
     cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", (username,))
     ```

3. **Handle Authentication and Authorization Securely:**
   - Use robust authentication mechanisms and ensure that authorization checks are in place.
   - Consider using frameworks like [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for managing user sessions.

4. **Protect Against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
   - Implement CSRF tokens in forms to ensure that requests are genuine.
   - Frameworks like Django and Flask have built-in support or extensions for CSRF protection.

5. **Secure Configuration Management:**
   - Keep secret keys, API keys, and database credentials out of the source code. Use environment variables or configuration files with proper access controls.
   - Example using environment variables:
     ```python
     import os
     SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
     ```

6. **Use HTTPS:**
   - Ensure that your web application is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

7. **Regularly Update Dependencies:**
   - Keep your libraries and frameworks up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` or `Safety` to check for vulnerable dependencies.

8. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Avoid exposing detailed error messages to users. Log errors securely for debugging purposes.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import logging
     logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.ERROR)
     try:
         # risky operation
     except Exception as e:
         logging.error("An error occurred: %s", e)
         # Return a generic error message to the user
     ```

9. **Implement Security Headers:**
   - Use HTTP headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` to enhance security.
   - Example using Flask:
     ```python
     from flask import Flask, make_response

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.after_request
     def set_security_headers(response):
         response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
         response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
         response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
         return response
     ```

10. **Use Framework Security Features:**
    - Utilize built-in security features provided by web frameworks like Django or Flask.
    - For example, Django has built-in protection against many common vulnerabilities.

Once you provide the specific code, I can offer more targeted advice and identify particular vulnerabilities present in your application.
